Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter? The seemingly simple action triggers a complex series of processes involving DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load-balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. In this blog post, we will unravel the layers of this fascinating journey to understand how you are seamlessly connected to the Google search engine.

DNS Request:
The journey begins with a DNS (Domain Name System) request. Your browser sends a query to a DNS resolver, asking for the IP address associated with "www.google.com". The DNS resolver then looks up the IP address from its cache or recursively queries other DNS servers until it finds the correct IP address.

TCP/IP:
Once the IP address is obtained, your browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server hosting Google's website. TCP breaks the data into packets and ensures reliable data transmission by establishing a connection-oriented session between your device and the server.

Firewall:
As a security measure, a firewall may be employed to protect the web server from unauthorized access. It examines incoming packets and filters out potentially harmful traffic, allowing only legitimate requests to proceed.

HTTPS/SSL:
Google utilizes the HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol, which encrypts the data transmitted between your browser and the server. When your browser establishes a connection, it negotiates an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged.

Load-Balancer:
To handle the massive influx of user requests efficiently, Google employs load-balancers. Load-balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple web servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

Web Server:
Once the request reaches a web server, it processes the HTTP request sent by your browser. The web server retrieves the requested web page or resource from its storage and generates an HTTP response, which includes the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other content required to render the page.

Application Server:
For dynamic content or complex functionalities, an application server comes into play. The application server handles the execution of server-side scripts or applications, such as search queries, user authentication, and customization. It interacts with databases and other services to generate the necessary data for the response.

Database:
Google's vast infrastructure relies on databases to store and retrieve data efficiently. When handling search queries, user information, or other data-intensive operations, the application server communicates with the appropriate databases to fetch or update the required information.
